        <h2>Initial task</h2>
        <blockquote>Counting objects (windows, roofs)</blockquote>
        <p>
            The given example images were taken from oblique angles and displayed really challenging subjects.
            On our pursuit of the ideal countable target objects Emanuela suggested to work with satellite images of informal settlements in developing countries.
        </p>
        <p>Both window counting and rooftop counting were approached in the existing literature, whereas <em>window counting</em> was often combined with 3D reconstruction of buildings from combinations of different images (satellite and ground view).</p>

        <h1>Our take on the task</h1>
        <p>
            We decided to focus on two bigger topics during our lab sessions. The first one would be teaching each other the basics of <em>Image Processing</em> via pair programming. Then we wanted to explore the given task in the context of satellite imaging.

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Teaching each other</h2>
        <p>
            We realized that our team did not only cover 4 different nations, 4 different scientific backgrounds but also very differing levels of experiece in programming. In order make the summer school a useful experience to all of us we decided to create a Image Processing tutorial. In teams of two, we solved small tasks ranging from basic file I/O to Machine Learning in both Python and MATLAB.
            <h2>
            The refugee camp Ifo 2 in Dabaab
            </h2>
            <p>
                The recent refugee crisis including camps in Turkey and the Balkan states have been one of the most covered topics in national and international media. But in Dabaab in Kenya, which is only 100km from Somalia, has been providing refuge for Somalis since the early 90's. In total there are five camps in Dabaab, the most recent two were constructed around 2010. We decided to work on images of one of these two newer camps, called <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/settlement.php?id=22&country=110&region=3">Ifo 2 Dabaab</a>.

            <h2>The slum Kibera in Nairobi</h2>
            <p>
                The second kind of informal settlement that we experimented with was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibera">Kibera</a>, a slum dsitrict in Nairobi, Kenya.
            </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>

            <h1>The grand challenge</h1>
            <p>One of the main challenges in the case of informal settlements is that the population is very hard to estimate. People arrive quickly and leave quickly. Often the amount of people staying in a building is fluctuating strongly and is almost impossible to ascertain.</p>
            <p>We decided to tackle this problem with the means of Image Processing and see how far we could get with a heterogeneous team of researchers and a few days to code.</p>

            <h2>Our (also grand) goal</h2>
            <p>
                Using image processing methods to count the slum buildings in order to provide useful data for national/international organizations.
